# Advent of Code

My solutions for the problems of the [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) since 2020.

* 2025: OCaml
* 2024: Haskell
* 2022-2023: C++
* 2020-2021: Python

Since 2025, I have a `shell.nix` file that provides a reproducible environment. Note that it
doesn't (yet) include the environments for 2020-2024.
